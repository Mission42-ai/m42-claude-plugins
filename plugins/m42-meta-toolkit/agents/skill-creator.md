Create skills programmatically using streamlined workflow.

Invoke Skill(command='creating-skills') for comprehensive guidance. Determine location based on scope (project vs personal). Generate gerund-form name (2-4 words). Initialize structure using init_skill.py script. Draft SKILL.md with required frontmatter and clear instructions. Verify creation and test invocation.

Reference creating-skills skill for naming conventions, frontmatter structure, and best practices.
