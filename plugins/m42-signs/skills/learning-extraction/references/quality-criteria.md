# Quality Criteria

## Inclusion Criteria

Extract learnings that meet ALL of these:

| Criterion | Test Question | Pass Example |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Project-specific** | Would this apply to other codebases? | "Sprint IDs use YYYY-MM-DD_name format parsed by status server" ✅ |
| **Non-obvious** | Is this clear from code inspection alone? | "Validation must run before emit phase" (not enforced by types) ✅ |
| **Reusable** | Will this help on future similar tasks? | "To debug workflows, check PROGRESS.yaml first" ✅ |
| **Verified** | Was this proven in the session? | Error occurred → investigated → confirmed root cause ✅ |

## Exclusion Criteria

Skip learnings that match ANY of these:

| Anti-Pattern | Reason | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Generic knowledge** | LLMs already know this | "Use async/await for async functions" ❌ |
| **One-time mistakes** | Not a recurring pattern | "Fixed typo: 'lenght' → 'length'" ❌ |
| **Obvious from code** | Already documented or self-evident | "Import React from 'react'" ❌ |
| **Context-specific decision** | Won't recur in other scenarios | "Used red button for this specific modal" ❌ |
| **Duplicate** | Similar sign exists in target CLAUDE.md | Check existing signs before extracting |
| **Unverified speculation** | Guessed but not confirmed | "This might be causing issues..." ❌ |

## Good Sign Characteristics

### 1. Actionable

Reader knows exactly what to do.

✅ **Good**: "When changing WorkflowDefinition, update: validate.ts (validation), compile.ts (compilation), status-server.ts (display)."

❌ **Vague**: "Be careful when changing types."

### 2. Specific

Applies to concrete files, functions, or scenarios in this codebase.

✅ **Good**: "yq requires `yq '.key['"$VAR"']'` syntax for variable expansion. Used in build scripts."

❌ **Generic**: "Learn the tools you're using."

### 3. Reusable

Helps with a class of tasks, not just the original scenario.

✅ **Good**: "To understand workflow compilation: read types.ts, then compile.ts, then validate.ts. Reverse order is confusing."

❌ **Too Narrow**: "Fixed build error on line 47 of compile.ts."

### 4. Concise

Easy to scan and understand quickly.

✅ **Good**: "Always run `npm run build` in plugins/m42-sprint/compiler after TS changes. Sprint loop uses compiled JS."

❌ **Verbose**: "When making changes to TypeScript files in the compiler directory, it's important to remember that the sprint execution loop doesn't use the TypeScript source files directly, but instead relies on the compiled JavaScript output that gets generated by the build process, so you should always make sure to run the npm build script..."

## Quality Evaluation

### High-Quality Learning

Meets ALL four characteristics (actionable, specific, reusable, concise) + inclusion criteria.

**Example**: "YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md uses 'description' for triggers, NOT 'trigger-on'. Field 'trigger-on' is invalid per schema validation."

- ✅ Actionable: Use 'description' field
- ✅ Specific: SKILL.md frontmatter, exact field names
- ✅ Reusable: Applies to all skill creation
- ✅ Concise: Two sentences

### Medium-Quality Learning

Meets 2-3 characteristics, or high-quality but narrow scope.

**Example**: "When debugging test failures in tests/integration/, check fixture setup first."

- ✅ Actionable: Check fixtures first
- ✅ Specific: tests/integration/
- ⚠️ Reusable: Only for integration test debugging
- ✅ Concise: One sentence

### Low-Quality Learning

Meets 0-1 characteristics, or fails inclusion criteria.

**Example**: "Make sure to write good code."

- ❌ Actionable: No concrete action
- ❌ Specific: No project context
- ❌ Reusable: Too generic
- ✅ Concise: Short but useless

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. "Lessons Learned" Style

❌ **Wrong**: "I learned that TypeScript interfaces can have optional fields."

✅ **Correct**: "When making TypeScript interface fields optional, ALL consumers must add null checks or build fails with TS18048."

**Fix**: Focus on project-specific application, not general concept explanation.

### 2. Over-Explanation

❌ **Wrong**: "The reason we need to run the build command is that TypeScript doesn't execute directly, instead it needs to be transpiled to JavaScript first, and the sprint execution loop is configured to use the compiled output rather than the source files, which means that any changes to the TypeScript source won't be reflected in execution until after compilation completes."

✅ **Correct**: "Always run `npm run build` in plugins/m42-sprint/compiler after TS changes. Sprint loop uses compiled JS from dist/."

**Fix**: State the rule concisely, one sentence for reasoning if needed.

### 3. No Actionable Guidance

❌ **Wrong**: "The workflow compiler is complex."

✅ **Correct**: "To understand workflow compilation: read types.ts, then compile.ts, then validate.ts in order."

**Fix**: Convert observations into concrete actions.

### 4. Missing Context

❌ **Wrong**: "Use the three-step pattern."

✅ **Correct**: "API handlers follow three steps: parse request → validate → execute. Validation errors return 400, execution errors return 500."

**Fix**: Include enough context to apply the guidance.

### 5. Duplicate Prevention Miss

❌ **Wrong**: Extracting "Use TDD for testing" when target CLAUDE.md already says "Follow TDD: RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle."

✅ **Correct**: Check target CLAUDE.md for existing signs before extracting. Skip if similar guidance exists.

**Fix**: Always cross-reference target file during extraction.

## Decision Tree

```
Is this learning project-specific?
├─ No → ❌ Skip (generic knowledge)
└─ Yes
    └─ Is it obvious from code/comments?
        ├─ Yes → ❌ Skip (already documented)
        └─ No
            └─ Will it help on future similar tasks?
                ├─ No → ❌ Skip (not reusable)
                └─ Yes
                    └─ Is it actionable and specific?
                        ├─ No → ⚠️ Rewrite to be actionable/specific
                        └─ Yes
                            └─ Does similar sign exist in target?
                                ├─ Yes → ❌ Skip (duplicate)
                                └─ No → ✅ Extract
```

## Quality Scoring

Use this rubric during quality review:

| Dimension | Weight | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Actionability** | 25% | Vague guidance | Clear action, missing details | Explicit, step-by-step |
| **Specificity** | 25% | Generic | Project-specific, somewhat vague | Concrete files/functions/scenarios |
| **Reusability** | 25% | One-time scenario | Helps with task category | Widely applicable in project |
| **Clarity** | 25% | Confusing or verbose | Understandable, could be tighter | Concise and clear |

**Overall Score** = (Actionability × 0.25) + (Specificity × 0.25) + (Reusability × 0.25) + (Clarity × 0.25)

- **≥2.5**: High quality → Extract
- **2.0-2.4**: Medium quality → Extract if fills gap
- **<2.0**: Low quality → Skip or rewrite

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing an extracted learning:

- [ ] Is it project-specific (not generic software engineering)?
- [ ] Is it non-obvious (not clear from code alone)?
- [ ] Will it help future agents on similar tasks?
- [ ] Was it verified in the session (not speculation)?
- [ ] Is it actionable (clear what to do)?
- [ ] Is it specific (concrete files/scenarios)?
- [ ] Is it concise (easy to scan)?
- [ ] Does it avoid duplicating existing signs in target CLAUDE.md?
- [ ] Does it meet quality score threshold (≥2.0)?

If any checklist item fails, revise or skip the learning.
