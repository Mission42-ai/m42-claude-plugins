# Example learning entry (uncomment and modify):
# - id: yq-variable-quoting
#   status: pending
#   title: Quote Variables in yq Expressions
#   problem: |
#     yq commands fail silently when shell variables aren't quoted
#     in the expression. The variable expands before yq parses it,
#     leading to syntax errors or empty results.
#   solution: |
#     Always wrap yq expressions in single quotes and use shell
#     variable expansion explicitly:
#     yq eval '.phases['"$IDX"'].status' PROGRESS.yaml
#   target: scripts/CLAUDE.md
#   confidence: high
#   source:
#     tool: Bash
#     command: "yq '.phases[$IDX].status' PROGRESS.yaml"
#     error: "returned empty string instead of expected status value"
