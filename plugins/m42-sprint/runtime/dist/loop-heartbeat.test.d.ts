/**
 * Tests for Loop Heartbeat and Signal Handlers - Step 2
 *
 * These tests verify that:
 * 1. Loop writes 'last-activity' timestamp each iteration
 * 2. SIGTERM handler marks sprint as 'interrupted'
 * 3. SIGINT handler marks sprint as 'interrupted'
 * 4. Signal handlers write interrupted timestamp before exit
 *
 * RED Phase: All tests should FAIL until implementation is complete.
