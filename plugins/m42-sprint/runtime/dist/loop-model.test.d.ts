/**
 * Tests for Model Selection in Runtime Loop
 *
 * RED PHASE: These tests define expected behavior BEFORE implementation.
 * All tests should FAIL until the model selection feature is implemented.
 *
 * The runtime loop should:
 * 1. Read the `model` field from the current phase in PROGRESS.yaml
 * 2. Pass the model to claude-runner when invoking Claude CLI
