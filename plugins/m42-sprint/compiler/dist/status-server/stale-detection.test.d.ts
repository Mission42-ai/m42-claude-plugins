/**
 * Tests for Stale Sprint Detection - Step 2
 *
 * These tests verify that:
 * 1. Sprint is marked stale if in-progress and last-activity > 15 minutes
 * 2. Active sprints (last-activity < 15 minutes) are NOT stale
 * 3. StatusUpdate includes isStale flag
 * 4. UI shows "Stale" badge and "Resume Sprint" button
 *
 * RED Phase: All tests should FAIL until implementation is complete.
