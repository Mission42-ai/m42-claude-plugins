/**
 * Tests for Resume Endpoint - Step 2
 *
 * These tests verify that:
 * 1. POST /api/sprint/:id/resume endpoint exists
 * 2. Resume creates a signal file for the sprint runner to pick up
 * 3. Resume rejects non-resumable sprints (completed, etc.)
 * 4. Resume returns appropriate success/error responses
 *
 * GREEN Phase: Tests should PASS now that implementation is complete.
