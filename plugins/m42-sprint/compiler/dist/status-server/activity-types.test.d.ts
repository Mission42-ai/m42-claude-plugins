/**
 * Tests for Activity Types - Step 0: Chat-Like Live Activity UI
 *
 * Tests the ActivityEvent type guard for the new 'assistant' event type
 * which will be used to display chat-like messages in the Live Activity panel.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - ActivityEvent supports both 'tool' and 'assistant' types
 * - Assistant events have optional text and isThinking fields
 * - Type guard validates all required and optional fields correctly
 *
 * RED PHASE: These tests should FAIL until activity-types.ts is updated
 * to support the 'assistant' event type.
