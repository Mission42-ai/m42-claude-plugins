/**
 * Tests for BUG-006: Total Sprint Duration Not Displayed
 *
 * Issue: The sprint detail page does not prominently display the total
 * sprint duration. For completed sprints, users cannot see how long the
 * sprint took in total.
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - For completed sprints: show final total elapsed time (e.g., "2h 34m 12s")
 * - For running sprints: show current elapsed time (updating)
 * - Format should be human-readable
 *
 * Location: Status server sprint detail page (page.ts)
