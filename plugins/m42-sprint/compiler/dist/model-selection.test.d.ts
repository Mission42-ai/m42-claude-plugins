/**
 * Tests for Model Selection Feature
 *
 * RED PHASE: These tests define expected behavior BEFORE implementation.
 * All tests should FAIL until the model selection feature is implemented.
 *
 * Model selection allows setting the Claude model (sonnet, opus, haiku) at different levels:
 * - workflow (default for all phases)
 * - sprint (overrides workflow)
 * - phase (overrides sprint)
 * - step (overrides phase) - highest priority
 *
 * Override priority: step > phase > sprint > workflow
