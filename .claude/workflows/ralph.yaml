description: Autonomous goal-driven execution with configurable per-iteration hooks

mode: ralph

goal-prompt: |
  Analyze the goal and create initial implementation steps.
  Break down complex goals into concrete, actionable tasks.
  Consider dependencies between tasks and order them appropriately.
  Start with investigation/research if the problem space is unclear.

reflection-prompt: |
  No pending steps remain. Evaluate:
  1. Is the goal fully achieved?
  2. Are there edge cases or tests missing?
  3. Is documentation complete?
  4. Are there any cleanup tasks needed?

  If complete: RALPH_COMPLETE: [summary]
  If not: add more steps to address gaps

# Deterministic hooks - executed per iteration
# Default disabled, enable via SPRINT.yaml overrides
