      Diagnose Activity Feed Bug on Status Page

      Issue: The Activity Feed on the Status Page is not functioning. The hook appears not to be running.

      Investigation tasks:
      - Locate the Activity Feed component in the Status Page code
      - Identify which hook should be triggering the Activity Feed updates
      - Check if the hook is properly registered and configured
      - Verify the hook's execution path and any error logs
      - Document the root cause of the failure

      Expected outputs:
      - Detailed diagnosis report in context/diagnosis.md
      - List of affected files and components
      - Root cause analysis

  - prompt: |
      Fix Activity Feed Hook Implementation

      Based on the diagnosis from the previous step, implement the fix for the Activity Feed hook.

      Fix tasks:
      - Apply the necessary code changes to fix the hook
      - Ensure hook is properly registered in settings or configuration
      - Add error handling if missing
      - Update any related documentation
      - Test the hook manually to confirm it executes

      Expected outputs:
      - Fixed hook implementation
      - Updated configuration if needed
      - Code comments explaining the fix

  - prompt: |
      Verify Activity Feed Functionality

      Comprehensive verification that the Activity Feed works correctly after the fix.

      Verification tasks:
      - Start the status page server
      - Verify the Activity Feed displays correctly
      - Trigger various events that should update the feed
      - Monitor hook execution logs for any errors
      - Test edge cases (empty feed, many updates, etc.)
      - Document the verification results

      Expected outputs:
      - Verification report in artifacts/verification-report.md
      - Screenshots or logs showing working Activity Feed
      - List of tested scenarios with pass/fail status
