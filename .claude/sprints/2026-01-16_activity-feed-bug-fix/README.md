# Activity Feed Bug Fix Sprint

**Sprint ID**: 2026-01-16_activity-feed-bug-fix
**Created**: 2026-01-16T17:37:51+01:00
**Workflow**: bugfix-workflow
**Priority**: High

## Problem Statement

The Activity Feed on the Status Page is not functioning correctly. The hook that should trigger the Activity Feed updates appears not to be running.

## Sprint Objectives

1. **Diagnose** the root cause of the Activity Feed failure
2. **Fix** the hook implementation and configuration
3. **Verify** the Activity Feed works correctly after the fix

## Sprint Structure

This sprint uses the `bugfix-workflow` which follows a three-phase approach:
- **Diagnose**: Investigate and identify the root cause
- **Fix**: Implement the solution
- **Verify**: Confirm the fix works correctly
