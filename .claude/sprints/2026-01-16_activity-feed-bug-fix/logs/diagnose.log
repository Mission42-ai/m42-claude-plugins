## Diagnosis Complete

**Root Cause Identified:** The `.sprint-hooks.json` file is generated but never applied to Claude Code. The `--hook-config` parameter in `sprint-loop.sh` is accepted but intentionally ignored (as confirmed by the comment on line 651).

**Key Finding:** Claude Code hooks must be registered in either `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.json` (project) - there's no CLI option to pass hook configuration at runtime.

**Impact:**
- PostToolUse hook never fires
- `.sprint-activity.jsonl` is never created
- ActivityWatcher has nothing to watch
- Activity Feed shows no events

**Recommended Fix:** Merge hook configuration into project `.claude/settings.json` before sprint starts, then restore after completion.

The diagnosis has been committed. Phase advanced to `fix` (phase 1). Exiting as instructed.
