## Sprint Completed

The **Activity Feed Bug Fix** sprint is now complete.

### Summary

**Bug:** The Activity Feed on the Status Page was not functioning because the hook configuration was generated as `.sprint-hooks.json` but never applied to Claude Code.

**Root Cause:** Claude Code only reads hooks from `.claude/settings.json`, not from arbitrary files. The CLI has no `--hook-config` flag.

**Fix Applied (commit 4dca6c8):**
1. `run-sprint.md` - Now merges hook config into `.claude/settings.json` before launching
2. `sprint-loop.sh` - Added trap to cleanup hooks from settings on exit
3. `stop-sprint.md` - Removes hooks from settings when stopping

**Verification:**
- All code changes reviewed and confirmed correct
- Hook registration/cleanup logic validated
- Verification report created at `artifacts/verification-report.md`
- No regressions identified
