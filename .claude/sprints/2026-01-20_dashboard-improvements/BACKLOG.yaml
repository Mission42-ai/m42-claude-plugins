    title: "Remove hook system from m42-sprint"
    description: |
      The m42-sprint plugin currently has a hook system for PostToolUse events
      that writes to .sprint-activity.jsonl. This system is being deprecated
      in favor of a different approach (likely transcription-based).

      Tasks:
      1. Remove hooks/ directory from plugin
      2. Remove hook registration from run-sprint command
      3. Remove hook references from skills (orchestrating-sprints, etc.)
      4. Remove hook references from commands (run-sprint, start-sprint, etc.)
      5. Update documentation to remove hook mentions
      6. Clean up settings.json manipulation code
      7. Remove .sprint-hooks.json generation

      Files to audit for hook references:
      - plugins/m42-sprint/skills/orchestrating-sprints/
      - plugins/m42-sprint/runtime/src/
      - plugins/m42-sprint/hooks/
      - .claude/commands/ (sprint-related)
