    description: "Investigate and integrate the ralph-loop plugin functionality into the m42-sprint plugin system. The ralph-loop provides autonomous task processing with hooks and control flow logic. Research the existing ralph-loop implementation (hooks, task execution logic, state management) and incorporate it into m42-sprint so that sprint tasks can be executed autonomously using the ralph-loop pattern. This includes understanding the hook system, task queue processing, and any relevant execution patterns."

    description: "Update the run-sprint command to require an explicit sprint directory path as a required argument. The user must provide the path to the sprint directory (e.g., /run-sprint .claude/sprints/2026-01-15_Refine-sprint). Update the command to parse this path argument and use it to locate SPRINT.yaml and PROGRESS.yaml files."
