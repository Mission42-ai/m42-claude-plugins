    description: "Audit all file path references in the m42-sprint plugin (plugins/m42-sprint/) to ensure they use correct relative paths. Commands and skills may reference assets, templates, or other files using incorrect paths (e.g., referencing .claude/skills/ instead of the actual plugin location). Scan all markdown files, YAML configs, and command definitions for hardcoded paths and verify each reference resolves correctly."

  - id: custom-fix-start-sprint-template-paths
    type: custom
    description: "Fix the start-sprint command (plugins/m42-sprint/commands/start-sprint.md) which references template files at incorrect paths. The command instructs to read templates from '.claude/skills/orchestrating-sprints/assets/' but the actual templates (sprint-template.yaml, progress-template.yaml) are located at 'plugins/m42-sprint/skills/orchestrating-sprints/assets/'. Update the command to use correct relative paths or make paths dynamic based on plugin installation location."
    done-when: "start-sprint command references correct template paths and templates are successfully loaded when command executes"

  - id: custom-integrate-ralph-loop
    type: custom
    description: "Investigate and integrate the ralph-loop plugin functionality into the m42-sprint plugin system. The ralph-loop provides autonomous task processing with hooks and control flow logic. Research the existing ralph-loop implementation (hooks, task execution logic, state management) and incorporate it into m42-sprint so that sprint tasks can be executed autonomously using the ralph-loop pattern. This includes understanding the hook system, task queue processing, and any relevant execution patterns."
    done-when: "Ralph-loop hooks and execution logic are successfully integrated into m42-sprint plugin, allowing autonomous task processing during sprint execution"

  - id: custom-fix-run-sprint-paths
    type: custom
    description: "Update the run-sprint command to require an explicit sprint directory path as a required argument. The user must provide the path to the sprint directory (e.g., /run-sprint .claude/sprints/2026-01-15_Refine-sprint). Update the command to parse this path argument and use it to locate SPRINT.yaml and PROGRESS.yaml files."
    done-when: "run-sprint command requires a sprint directory path argument and uses it to correctly locate and read SPRINT.yaml and PROGRESS.yaml files"
