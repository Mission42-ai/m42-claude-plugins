Context gathering for step-4 is complete. I have created the context document covering:

- **Related Code Patterns**: `ProgressWatcher` in `watcher.ts` as the reference implementation for EventEmitter pattern
- **Required Imports**: `EventEmitter` from Node.js `events` module
- **Types/Interfaces**: Proposed `StatusServerEvents` interface and `DEFAULT_READY_TIMEOUT` constant
- **Integration Points**: How `index.ts` will call `waitForReady()`, and where the ready event should be emitted in `start()`
- **Implementation Notes**: Key details like using `extends EventEmitter`, tracking ready state, timeout pattern with `Promise.race()`, and ensuring no breaking changes

The sub-phase has been marked complete and the pointer advanced to sub-phase 2 (plan).
