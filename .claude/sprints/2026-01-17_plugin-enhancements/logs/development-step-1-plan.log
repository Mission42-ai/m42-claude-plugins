Plan sub-phase completed for step-1. Created 6 gherkin scenarios to verify the max-iterations default value update from 30 to 60 across all documentation files:

1. **run-sprint.md has default 60** - verifies the command documentation shows 60
2. **commands.md reference has default 60** - verifies the options table shows 60
3. **USER-GUIDE.md has default 60** - verifies the user guide shows 60
4. **No remaining default: 30 in run-sprint.md** - ensures no old value remains
5. **No remaining default: 30 in commands.md** - ensures no old value remains
6. **No remaining default: 30 in USER-GUIDE.md** - ensures no old value remains

Committed and advanced to next sub-phase (execute). Exiting as instructed.
