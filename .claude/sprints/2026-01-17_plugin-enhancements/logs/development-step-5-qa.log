QA completed successfully for step-5.

## Summary

**QA Report: step-5** - All scenarios PASS (7/7 = 100%)

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1. openBrowser import exists | ✓ PASS |
| 2. waitForReady is called | ✓ PASS |
| 3. openBrowser is called with URL | ✓ PASS |
| 4. --no-browser flag defined | ✓ PASS |
| 5. Browser open is conditional | ✓ PASS |
| 6. Server URL is logged | ✓ PASS |
| 7. TypeScript compiles | ✓ PASS |

Note: Scenario 5's original gherkin pattern expected `!noBrowser` but the implementation correctly uses commander.js convention `if (options.browser)` which achieves the same result.

Progress updated: sub-phase 4 (qa) completed, pointer advanced to sub-phase 4 (commit).
