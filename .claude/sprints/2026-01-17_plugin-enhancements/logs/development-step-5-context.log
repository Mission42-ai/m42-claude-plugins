Context sub-phase complete for step-5. I've gathered implementation context including:

- **Related patterns**: CLI option definition, server startup sequence, `waitForReady()` method, browser opener utility
- **Required imports**: `openBrowser` from `./browser.js`
- **Integration points**: How status server is launched by sprint-loop and run-sprint command
- **Implementation notes**: Commander `--no-browser` option conversion, startup sequence with `waitForReady()`, URL logging

The context document is saved at `context/step-5-context.md` and PROGRESS.yaml has been updated to advance to the next sub-phase (implement).
