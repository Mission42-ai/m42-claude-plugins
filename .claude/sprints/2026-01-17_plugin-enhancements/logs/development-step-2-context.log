  - The current `showNotification()` function that lacks error handling
  - Related code patterns for try-catch, toast fallback, and console logging
  - HTML structure showing where to add the Test Notification button
  - Elements object pattern for registering new DOM elements
  - AudioContext pre-initialization pattern for browser autoplay policy compliance
  - All 6 verification commands from the gherkin scenarios
