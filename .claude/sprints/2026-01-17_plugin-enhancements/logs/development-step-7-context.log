Context sub-phase completed. I gathered implementation context for step-7 which includes:

**Findings:**
- Error category types (`ErrorCategory`) are already defined in `types.ts`
- CSS styling for error category badges already exists in `page.ts`
- Error category badge display is already implemented in `renderTreeNode()`
- The `error` field is passed through the transform pipeline to `PhaseTreeNode`

**What needs to be added:**
1. `RECOVERY_SUGGESTIONS` mapping with all 5 error categories and messages
2. `getRecoverySuggestion()` function to lookup suggestions
3. CSS styles for `.error-details`, `.recovery-suggestion`, `.error-message`
4. "View Error Details" expandable section in phase cards for failed phases
5. Click handlers to toggle the expandable section

The context document is now at `context/step-7-context.md` with detailed patterns and implementation notes.
