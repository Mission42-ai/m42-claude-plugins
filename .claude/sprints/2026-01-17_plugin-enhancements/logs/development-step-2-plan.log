**Plan sub-phase complete for step-2.**

Created 6 gherkin scenarios in `artifacts/step-2-gherkin.md`:
1. showNotification has try-catch error handling
2. AudioContext pre-initialization on user click
3. Test Notification button exists
4. Toast fallback when notifications fail
5. Notification errors logged to console
6. TypeScript compiles without errors

Progress updated. Exiting as instructed.
