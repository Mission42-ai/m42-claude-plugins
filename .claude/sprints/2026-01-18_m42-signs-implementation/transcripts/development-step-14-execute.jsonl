The key insight:\n\n> \"Each time Ralph does something bad, Ralph gets tuned.\"\n\nLike adding signs to a playground (\"SLIDE DOWN, DON'T JUMP\"), we accumulate guidance in the codebase itself. This is **not ML** - it's explicit, human-curated wisdom that makes autonomous agents increasingly effective over time.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n1. **Failures are tuning opportunities** - Every error teaches something\n2. **Signs persist** - Knowledge survives sessions\n3. **Codebase as instruction set** - The environment guides behavior\n4. **Eventual consistency** - Given enough signs, complex tasks succeed\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n```\n.claude/signs/                    # Global signs (all projects)\n├── typescript-patterns.md\n├── testing-gotchas.md\n├── yaml-handling.md\n└── api-interactions.md\n\n$PROJECT/.claude/signs/           # Project-specific signs\n├── domain-knowledge.md\n├── codebase-conventions.md\n└── learned-patterns.md\n\n$SPRINT_DIR/signs.md              # Sprint-specific signs (ephemeral)\n```\n\n## Sign Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Sign: Quote Variables in yq Expressions\n\n## Context\n- Categories: yaml, shell, tooling\n- Applies to: validation phases, any yq usage\n- Learned from: sprint/2026-01-16 step-3 retry\n\n## Problem\nyq commands fail silently or return empty when variables aren't quoted:\n```bash\n# Fails\nyq '.phases[$IDX].status' file.yaml\n```\n\n## Solution\nAlways quote variable references in yq:\n```bash\n# Works\nyq '.phases['\"$IDX\"'].status' file.yaml\n```\n\n## Evidence\n- Failure rate before: 3/10 phases\n- Failure rate after: 0/10 phases\n```\n\n## Planned Features\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- [ ] Sign storage format (markdown with frontmatter)\n- [ ] Directory structure (global, project, sprint levels)\n- [ ] Basic CRUD commands (`/signs add`, `/signs list`, `/signs search`)\n- [ ] Manual sign creation workflow\n\n### Phase 2: Integration\n- [ ] Query API for m42-sprint integration\n- [ ] Relevance matching (categories, keywords, phase types)\n- [ ] Prompt injection during sprint execution\n- [ ] Sign loading in build-sprint-prompt.sh\n\n### Phase 3: Learning\n- [ ] Capture diff between failed and successful retry attempts\n- [ ] Propose signs automatically after retry success\n- [ ] Human approval workflow for auto-generated signs\n- [ ] Confidence scoring for signs\n\n### Phase 4: Intelligence\n- [ ] Sign effectiveness tracking (does this sign reduce failures?)\n- [ ] Sign deprecation (outdated patterns)\n- [ ] Cross-project sign sharing\n- [ ] Sign conflict detection\n\n## Integration with m42-sprint\n\n```bash\n# In build-sprint-prompt.sh:\n\n# 1. Determine context\nPHASE_TYPE=\"implementation\"\nERROR_CATEGORY=\"yaml\"\nTOOLS_USED=\"yq,bash\"\n\n# 2. Query relevant signs\nSIGNS=$(m42-signs query \\\n  --categories \"$ERROR_CATEGORY\" \\\n  --phase-type \"$PHASE_TYPE\" \\\n  --tools \"$TOOLS_USED\" \\\n  --limit 5)\n\n# 3. Inject into prompt\ncat <<EOF\n## Relevant Guidance\n\n$SIGNS\n\n## Your Task\n...\nEOF\n```\n\n## Commands (Planned)\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/signs add` | Create a new sign interactively |\n| `/signs list` | List all signs with filtering |\n| `/signs search <query>` | Search signs by content/category |\n| `/signs show <id>` | Display a specific sign |\n| `/signs edit <id>` | Edit an existing sign |\n| `/signs delete <id>` | Remove a sign |\n| `/signs import <file>` | Import signs from file |\n| `/signs export` | Export all signs |\n| `/signs stats` | Show sign usage statistics |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Sign format**: Pure markdown? Markdown + YAML frontmatter? Structured YAML?\n2. **Relevance algorithm**: Keyword matching? Embeddings? Category hierarchy?\n3. **Scope inheritance**: Do global signs override project signs or merge?\n4. **Version control**: Track sign history? Git integration?\n5. **Sign validation**: How to verify a sign actually helps?\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- **Ralph Loop** - The execution pattern that benefits from signs\n- **Prompt engineering** - Signs are essentially accumulated prompt improvements\n- **Knowledge bases** - But simpler, text-based, human-readable\n- **Test fixtures** - Signs are like fixtures for agent behavior\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Design the sign file format (frontmatter schema)\n2. Implement basic storage and retrieval\n3. Create `/signs add` command\n4. Integrate with m42-sprint prompt construction\n5. Build feedback loop for sign effectiveness\n\n---\n\n*This plugin represents a shift from \"disposable context\" to \"accumulated wisdom\" - making each failure a permanent improvement to the system.*\n","numLines":160,"startLine":1,"totalLines":160}}}

The key insight:\n\n> \"Each time Ralph does something bad, Ralph gets tuned.\"\n\nLike adding signs to a playground (\"SLIDE DOWN, DON'T JUMP\"), we accumulate guidance in the codebase itself. This is **not ML** - it's explicit, human-curated wisdom that makes autonomous agents increasingly effective over time.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n1. **Failures are tuning opportunities** - Every error teaches something\n2. **Signs persist** - Knowledge survives sessions\n3. **Codebase as instruction set** - The environment guides behavior\n4. **Eventual consistency** - Given enough signs, complex tasks succeed\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n```\n.claude/signs/                    # Global signs (all projects)\n├── typescript-patterns.md\n├── testing-gotchas.md\n├── yaml-handling.md\n└── api-interactions.md\n\n$PROJECT/.claude/signs/           # Project-specific signs\n├── domain-knowledge.md\n├── codebase-conventions.md\n└── learned-patterns.md\n\n$SPRINT_DIR/signs.md              # Sprint-specific signs (ephemeral)\n```\n\n## Sign Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Sign: Quote Variables in yq Expressions\n\n## Context\n- Categories: yaml, shell, tooling\n- Applies to: validation phases, any yq usage\n- Learned from: sprint/2026-01-16 step-3 retry\n\n## Problem\nyq commands fail silently or return empty when variables aren't quoted:\n```bash\n# Fails\nyq '.phases[$IDX].status' file.yaml\n```\n\n## Solution\nAlways quote variable references in yq:\n```bash\n# Works\nyq '.phases['\"$IDX\"'].status' file.yaml\n```\n\n## Evidence\n- Failure rate before: 3/10 phases\n- Failure rate after: 0/10 phases\n```\n\n## Planned Features\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- [ ] Sign storage format (markdown with frontmatter)\n- [ ] Directory structure (global, project, sprint levels)\n- [ ] Basic CRUD commands (`/signs add`, `/signs list`, `/signs search`)\n- [ ] Manual sign creation workflow\n\n### Phase 2: Integration\n- [ ] Query API for m42-sprint integration\n- [ ] Relevance matching (categories, keywords, phase types)\n- [ ] Prompt injection during sprint execution\n- [ ] Sign loading in build-sprint-prompt.sh\n\n### Phase 3: Learning\n- [ ] Capture diff between failed and successful retry attempts\n- [ ] Propose signs automatically after retry success\n- [ ] Human approval workflow for auto-generated signs\n- [ ] Confidence scoring for signs\n\n### Phase 4: Intelligence\n- [ ] Sign effectiveness tracking (does this sign reduce failures?)\n- [ ] Sign deprecation (outdated patterns)\n- [ ] Cross-project sign sharing\n- [ ] Sign conflict detection\n\n## Integration with m42-sprint\n\n```bash\n# In build-sprint-prompt.sh:\n\n# 1. Determine context\nPHASE_TYPE=\"implementation\"\nERROR_CATEGORY=\"yaml\"\nTOOLS_USED=\"yq,bash\"\n\n# 2. Query relevant signs\nSIGNS=$(m42-signs query \\\n  --categories \"$ERROR_CATEGORY\" \\\n  --phase-type \"$PHASE_TYPE\" \\\n  --tools \"$TOOLS_USED\" \\\n  --limit 5)\n\n# 3. Inject into prompt\ncat <<EOF\n## Relevant Guidance\n\n$SIGNS\n\n## Your Task\n...\nEOF\n```\n\n## Commands (Planned)\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/signs add` | Create a new sign interactively |\n| `/signs list` | List all signs with filtering |\n| `/signs search <query>` | Search signs by content/category |\n| `/signs show <id>` | Display a specific sign |\n| `/signs edit <id>` | Edit an existing sign |\n| `/signs delete <id>` | Remove a sign |\n| `/signs import <file>` | Import signs from file |\n| `/signs export` | Export all signs |\n| `/signs stats` | Show sign usage statistics |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Sign format**: Pure markdown? Markdown + YAML frontmatter? Structured YAML?\n2. **Relevance algorithm**: Keyword matching? Embeddings? Category hierarchy?\n3. **Scope inheritance**: Do global signs override project signs or merge?\n4. **Version control**: Track sign history? Git integration?\n5. **Sign validation**: How to verify a sign actually helps?\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- **Ralph Loop** - The execution pattern that benefits from signs\n- **Prompt engineering** - Signs are essentially accumulated prompt improvements\n- **Knowledge bases** - But simpler, text-based, human-readable\n- **Test fixtures** - Signs are like fixtures for agent behavior\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Design the sign file format (frontmatter schema)\n2. Implement basic storage and retrieval\n3. Create `/signs add` command\n4. Integrate with m42-sprint prompt construction\n5. Build feedback loop for sign effectiveness\n\n---\n\n*This plugin represents a shift from \"disposable context\" to \"accumulated wisdom\" - making each failure a permanent improvement to the system.*\n"}}
