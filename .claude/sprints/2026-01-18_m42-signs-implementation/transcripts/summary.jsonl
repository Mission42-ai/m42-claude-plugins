This plugin extracts learnings from session transcripts, manages a review backlog, and applies approved signs to CLAUDE.md files throughout the codebase. The implementation follows the \"Ralph Loop\" pattern where failures are transformed into permanent, contextually-injected guidance.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Plugin structure matches m42-sprint patterns with valid plugin.json\n- [ ] Manual sign management works (/add, /list, /status commands)\n- [ ] Session transcript parsing extracts errors and retry patterns\n- [ ] Target CLAUDE.md inference is accurate for 90%+ of cases\n- [ ] Interactive review flow is intuitive with batch operations\n- [ ] Apply command properly formats and inserts signs\n- [ ] Git integration for atomic sign commits\n- [ ] Sprint workflow integration for automated extraction\n- [ ] Documentation complete and tested\n\n## Step Breakdown\n\n### Step 0: Phase 1.1 - Plugin Structure Setup\n**Scope**: Create foundational plugin structure\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/README.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/` (create directory)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/` (create structure)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/scripts/` (create directory)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/` (create directory)\n**Dependencies**: None\n**Risk**: Low - straightforward directory creation following existing patterns\n\n### Step 1: Phase 1.2 - Backlog Schema and Templates\n**Scope**: Define backlog YAML schema with validation\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/assets/backlog-template.yaml` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/references/backlog-schema.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/scripts/validate-backlog.sh` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Step 0 (directory structure)\n**Risk**: Low - schema design is documented in CONCEPT.md\n\n### Step 2: Phase 1.3 - Manual Sign Management Commands\n**Scope**: Implement /add, /list, /status, /help commands\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/add.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/list.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/status.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/help.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 0, 1 (structure + backlog schema)\n**Risk**: Medium - command logic needs careful validation handling\n\n### Step 3: Phase 2.1 - Transcript Parsing Logic\n**Scope**: Parse JSONL session files for errors\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/scripts/parse-transcript.sh` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/references/transcript-format.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Step 0 (structure)\n**Risk**: Medium - jq queries must handle all message types correctly\n\n### Step 4: Phase 2.2 - Error Pattern Detection\n**Scope**: Identify retry patterns (error → success sequences)\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/scripts/find-retry-patterns.sh` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Step 3 (transcript parsing)\n**Risk**: High - pattern matching heuristics may have edge cases\n\n### Step 5: Phase 2.3 - Target CLAUDE.md Inference\n**Scope**: Infer where signs should be stored\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/scripts/infer-target.sh` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 3, 4 (parsed transcripts with patterns)\n**Risk**: Medium - needs good heuristics for path analysis\n\n### Step 6: Phase 2.4 - Extraction Command\n**Scope**: Implement /extract command with full pipeline\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/extract.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 3, 4, 5 (full parsing pipeline)\n**Risk**: Medium - orchestrating multiple scripts\n\n### Step 7: Phase 3.1 - Interactive Review Command\n**Scope**: Implement /review with approve/reject/edit flow\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/review.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 1, 2 (backlog schema + add command)\n**Risk**: Medium - interactive flow complexity\n\n### Step 8: Phase 3.2 - Apply Command\n**Scope**: Apply approved learnings to CLAUDE.md files\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/apply.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/references/claude-md-format.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 7 (reviewed learnings)\n**Risk**: Medium - CLAUDE.md formatting must be consistent\n\n### Step 9: Phase 3.3 - Git Integration\n**Scope**: Optional git commit support for apply\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/commands/apply.md` (update)\n**Dependencies**: Step 8 (apply command)\n**Risk**: Low - git operations are straightforward\n\n### Step 10: Phase 4.1 - Sprint Workflow Integration\n**Scope**: Create workflow templates for sprint integration\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/assets/learning-extraction-workflow.yaml` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/assets/sprint-with-learning.yaml` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/SKILL.md` (update)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 6, 8 (extract + apply working)\n**Risk**: Low - follows m42-sprint workflow patterns\n\n### Step 11: Phase 5.1 - Getting Started Guide\n**Scope**: Create primary user documentation\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/getting-started.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/` (create structure)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/reference/` (create structure)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/README.md` (update)\n**Dependencies**: Steps 0-10 (working plugin)\n**Risk**: Low - documentation from tested functionality\n\n### Step 12: Phase 5.2 - How-To Guides\n**Scope**: Task-oriented how-to guides\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/add-sign-manually.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/extract-from-session.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/review-and-apply.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/integrate-with-sprint.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Step 11 (getting started)\n**Risk**: Low - documenting existing functionality\n\n### Step 13: Phase 5.3 - Reference Documentation\n**Scope**: Comprehensive reference docs\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/reference/commands.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/reference/backlog-format.md` (create)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/docs/reference/sign-format.md` (create)\n**Dependencies**: Step 11 (getting started)\n**Risk**: Low - documenting existing functionality\n\n### Step 14: Phase 5.4 - Final Polish and Testing\n**Scope**: Complete documentation and full workflow test\n**Files**:\n- `plugins/m42-signs/CONCEPT.md` (update)\n- `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/SKILL.md` (update)\n**Dependencies**: All previous steps\n**Risk**: Low - validation and polish\n\n## Step Dependency Graph\n\n```\nstep-0 (structure)\n   │\n   ├── step-1 (backlog schema)\n   │      │\n   │      └── step-2 (manual commands)\n   │             │\n   │             └── step-7 (review) ─────────┐\n   │                    │                     │\n   │                    └── step-8 (apply) ───┼── step-10 (sprint integration)\n   │                           │              │\n   │                           └── step-9 (git)\n   │\n   └── step-3 (transcript parsing)\n          │\n          └── step-4 (retry patterns)\n                 │\n                 └── step-5 (target inference)\n                        │\n                        └── step-6 (extract command)\n                               │\n                               └── step-10 (sprint integration)\n\nstep-10 ─┬── step-11 (getting started)\n         │      │\n         │      ├── step-12 (how-to guides)\n         │      │\n         │      └── step-13 (reference docs)\n         │\n         └── step-14 (final polish)\n```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| jq queries fail on edge cases | Medium | Test with real session transcripts, add error handling |\n| Retry pattern false positives | Medium | Conservative confidence scoring, human review as safety net |\n| Target inference misses | Low | Default to project root CLAUDE.md, allow manual override |\n| CLAUDE.md format conflicts | Low | Non-destructive append to ## Signs section |\n| Session file not found | Low | Clear error messages, suggest session listing |\n\n## Estimated Complexity\n\n| Step | Complexity | Reason |\n|------|------------|--------|\n| step-0 | Low | Directory creation following patterns |\n| step-1 | Low | Schema is well-defined in CONCEPT.md |\n| step-2 | Medium | Four commands with validation logic |\n| step-3 | Medium | jq queries for various message types |\n| step-4 | High | Pattern matching heuristics are complex |\n| step-5 | Medium | Path analysis heuristics |\n| step-6 | Medium | Orchestrating parsing pipeline |\n| step-7 | Medium | Interactive flow with edit mode |\n| step-8 | Medium | CLAUDE.md manipulation |\n| step-9 | Low | Standard git operations |\n| step-10 | Low | Following m42-sprint patterns |\n| step-11 | Low | Documentation from working code |\n| step-12 | Low | Task-focused guides |\n| step-13 | Low | Reference from code |\n| step-14 | Low | Validation and updates |\n\n## Workflow Used\n\n**Workflow**: `gherkin-verified-execution`\n\nThis workflow includes:\n1. **preflight** -

Workflow Integration\n- Created learning-extraction-workflow.yaml for post-sprint extraction\n- Added sprint-with-learning.yaml composite workflow\n- Updated SKILL.md with workflow integration guidance\n**Files**: `skills/managing-signs/assets/learning-extraction-workflow.yaml`, `skills/managing-signs/assets/sprint-with-learning.yaml`, `skills/managing-signs/SKILL.md`\n\n### Step 11: Getting Started Guide\n- Created comprehensive getting-started.md tutorial\n- Established docs/how-to/ and docs/reference/ directory structure\n- Updated README.md with quick start instructions\n**Files**: `docs/getting-started.md`, `README.md` (updated)\n\n### Step 12: How-To Guides\n- Created add-sign-manually.md how-to guide\n- Created extract-from-session.md how-to guide\n- Created review-and-apply.md how-to guide\n- Created integrate-with-sprint.md how-to guide\n**Files**: `docs/how-to/add-sign-manually.md`, `docs/how-to/extract-from-session.md`, `docs/how-to/review-and-apply.md`, `docs/how-to/integrate-with-sprint.md`\n\n### Step 13: Reference Documentation\n- Created commands.md unified command reference\n- Created backlog-format.md schema documentation\n- Created sign-format.md format specification\n**Files**: `docs/reference/commands.md`, `docs/reference/backlog-format.md`, `docs/reference/sign-format.md`\n\n### Step 14: Final Polish and Testing\n- Completed CONCEPT.md with final polish and implementation notes\n- Updated SKILL.md with complete feature documentation\n- Verified all integrations work end-to-end\n**Files**: `CONCEPT.md` (updated), `skills/managing-signs/SKILL.md` (updated)\n\n## Files Changed\n\n| File | Change Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
