Includes `--approve-all-high` and `--reject-all-low` batch options\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/commands/review.md`\n\n### Step 8: Apply Command\n- Implemented `/m42-signs:apply` command for applying approved learnings\n- Supports `--dry-run`, `--commit`, and `--targets` options\n- Creates `## Signs` section in CLAUDE.md files and updates backlog status\n- Added `claude-md-format.md` reference documentation\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/commands/apply.md`, `skills/managing-signs/references/claude-md-format.md`\n\n### Step 9: Git Commit Integration\n- Enhanced apply command with `--commit` flag for automatic git commits\n- Uses `signs: apply N learnings` commit message format\n- Stages only backlog.yaml and target CLAUDE.md files\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/commands/apply.md` (enhanced)\n\n### Step 10: Sprint Workflow Integration\n- Created `learning-extraction-workflow.yaml` for standalone extraction\n- Created `sprint-with-learning.yaml` as a complete sprint example\n- Added workflow integration documentation to SKILL.md\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/skills/managing-signs/assets/learning-extraction-workflow.yaml`, `assets/sprint-with-learning.yaml`, `SKILL.md`\n\n### Step 11: User Documentation Structure\n- Created `docs/getting-started.md` with prerequisites and installation\n- Created `docs/how-to/` directory with guide stubs\n- Created `docs/reference/` directory with commands.md and backlog-format.md\n- Enhanced README.md with installation info and documentation links\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/docs/getting-started.md`, `README.md`, `docs/reference/commands.md`, `docs/reference/backlog-format.md`\n\n### Step 12: How-To Guides Content\n- Created `add-sign-manually.md` with examples and use cases\n- Created `extract-from-session.md` with session ID location and confidence tuning\n- Created `review-and-apply.md` with interactive and batch workflows\n- Created `integrate-with-sprint.md` with workflow integration examples\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/docs/how-to/add-sign-manually.md`, `extract-from-session.md`, `review-and-apply.md`, `integrate-with-sprint.md`\n\n### Step 13: Reference Documentation\n- Enhanced `commands.md` with full syntax for all 7 commands\n- Enhanced `backlog-format.md` with complete YAML schema and status lifecycle\n- Created `sign-format.md` explaining how signs appear in CLAUDE.md\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/docs/reference/commands.md`, `backlog-format.md`, `sign-format.md`\n\n### Step 14: Final Polish and Validation\n- Marked all phases complete in CONCEPT.md (16 completed items)\n- Added Known Limitations and Changelog sections\n- Validated all internal documentation links\n- Verified no placeholder text (TODO/FIXME/TBD) in docs\n- Validated SKILL.md frontmatter with trigger keywords\n- Validated .claude-plugin configuration file\n**Files**: `plugins/m42-signs/CONCEPT.md`, `skills/managing-signs/SKILL.md`, `.claude-plugin`\n\n## Files Changed\n\n| File | Change Type |
