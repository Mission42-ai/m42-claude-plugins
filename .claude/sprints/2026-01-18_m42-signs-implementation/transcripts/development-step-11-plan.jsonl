Default: low (include all)\n- `--auto-approve` flag: Automatically set status to \"approved\" for high-confidence learnings\n- Required positional: `<session-id|file-path>` - Either a session UUID or full path to .jsonl file\n\n### Session File Resolution\n\n1. **If input looks like a UUID** (36 chars, format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx):\n   Search for the session file in `~/.claude/projects/*/`:\n   ```bash\n   find ~/.claude/projects -name \"<session-id>.jsonl\" 2>/dev/null | head -1\n   ```\n\n2. **If input is a file path**:\n   Verify the file exists at the given path.\n\n3. **If session file not found**:\n   Display clear error message:\n   ```\n   Error: Session file not found.\n\n   Searched for:\n   - ~/.claude/projects/*/<session-id>.jsonl\n\n   Provide a valid session ID or full file path.\n   Example:\n     /m42-signs:extract 02c29593-0a92-4207-9fd8-455a9021c715\n     /m42-signs:extract ~/.claude/projects/-home-user-project/session.jsonl\n   ```\n   Exit without further processing.\n\n### Pipeline Execution\n\nRun the parsing pipeline on the session file:\n\n#### Step 1: Parse Transcript\n\nRun `scripts/parse-transcript.sh` to extract tool errors:\n```bash\nplugins/m42-signs/scripts/parse-transcript.sh <session-file> --json\n```\n\nIf this fails or returns malformed output:\n```\nError: Could not parse session file.\n\nThe file may be corrupted or in an unexpected format.\nExpected: JSONL (JSON Lines) format\n\nCheck that the file contains valid Claude Code session data.\n```\nExit with graceful failure.\n\n#### Step 2: Find Retry Patterns\n\nRun `scripts/find-retry-patterns.sh` to detect error->retry->success sequences:\n```bash\nplugins/m42-signs/scripts/find-retry-patterns.sh <session-file> --json\n```\n\nThis returns patterns with confidence levels (low, medium, high).\n\n#### Step 3: Infer Target\n\nFor each pattern, run `scripts/infer-target.sh` to determine the target CLAUDE.md path:\n```bash\nplugins/m42-signs/scripts/infer-target.sh <file-paths-from-pattern>\n```\n\n### Confidence Filtering\n\nApply `--confidence-min` filter:\n- `low` (default): Include all patterns\n- `medium`: Include medium and high confidence only\n- `high`: Include high confidence only\n\n### Pattern to Learning Conversion\n\nConvert each retry pattern to a learning entry:\n\n```yaml\n- id: <tool-name>-<heuristic-match>-<context>  # kebab-case, unique\n  status: pending  # or \"approved\" if --auto-approve and confidence is high\n  title: <Generated from pattern type and tool>\n  problem: |\n    <Error message from the pattern>\n  solution: |\n    <Description of the fix based on diff between error and success inputs>\n  target: <CLAUDE.md path from infer-target.sh>\n  confidence: <low|medium|high from pattern>\n  source:\n    tool: automated\n    command: \"/m42-signs:extract\"\n    session: <session-file-path>\n    error: <error-tool-use-id>\n```\n\n### Dry Run Mode\n\nIf `--dry-run` is specified, display the proposed learnings WITHOUT writing to backlog:\n\n```\nDry Run: Proposed Learnings\n============================\n\nFrom: <session-file-path>\nPatterns found: <count>\nAfter confidence filter: <filtered-count>\n\n1. [<confidence>] <id>\n   Problem: <short problem description>\n   Solution: <short solution description>\n   Target: <target-path>\n\n2. [<confidence>] <id>\n   ...\n\nTo apply, run without --dry-run:\n  /m42-signs:extract <session-id>\n```\n\nExit without writing.\n\n### Write to Backlog\n\nIf NOT `--dry-run`:\n\n1. Create `.claude/learnings/` directory if it doesn't exist:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p .claude/learnings\n   ```\n\n2. If `.claude/learnings/backlog.yaml` doesn't exist, create it:\n   ```yaml\n   version: 1\n   extracted-from: <session-file-path>\n   extracted-at: <current ISO timestamp>\n   learnings: []\n   ```\n\n3. Append new learning entries to the `learnings` array.\n   Use Edit tool to update the file, preserving existing entries.\n\n4. Display success summary:\n   ```\n   Extraction Complete\n   ====================\n\n   Session: <session-file-path>\n   Patterns analyzed: <total-patterns>\n   Learnings extracted: <count-after-filter>\n\n   Added to backlog:\n     - [high] <id-1>: <title>\n     - [medium] <id-2>: <title>\n     ...\n\n   Next steps:\n     /m42-signs:review   - Review and approve/reject learnings\n     /m42-signs:status   - View backlog summary\n   ```\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n#### No Errors Found\n\nIf parse-transcript.sh returns no errors OR find-retry-patterns.sh returns no patterns:\n\n```\nNo learnings to extract.\n\nSession: <session-file-path>\nTotal errors: <count or 0>\nRetry patterns: 0\n\nThis session had no tool errors or the errors weren't followed by\nsuccessful retries. Nothing to learn from!\n\nTip: Learnings are extracted when Claude makes an error and then\nsuccessfully corrects it. Sessions without corrections have no\nlearnings to capture.\n```\n\n#### All Filtered Out\n\nIf patterns exist but all are filtered out by `--confidence-min`:\n\n```\nNo learnings at confidence level \"<level>\" or higher.\n\nSession: <session-file-path>\nTotal patterns found: <count>\nAfter filter: 0\n\nTry with a lower confidence threshold:\n  /m42-signs:extract --confidence-min low <session-id>\n```\n\n#### Duplicate Detection\n\nWhen adding to backlog, check if a learning with the same `id` already exists.\nIf so, skip it and note in output:\n```\nSkipped (already in backlog): <id>\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Session file is correctly resolved from ID or path\n- Pipeline runs all three scripts in sequence\n- Learnings are properly formatted in backlog.yaml\n- --dry-run shows preview without modifying files\n- --confidence-min filters patterns correctly\n- --auto-approve sets high-confidence learnings to \"approved\"\n- Clear error messages for all edge cases\n- Graceful failure for malformed JSONL\n- File not found produces helpful error message\n","numLines":252,"startLine":1,"totalLines":252}}}
