      Prepare sprint context and development plan.

      ## Your Role
      You are the sprint OPERATOR. Your job is to:
      1. Understand the sprint scope
      2. Research the codebase
      3. Create shared context for development phases

      ## Step 1: Read Sprint Definition
      Read the SPRINT.yaml to understand:
      - All steps and their requirements
      - Dependencies between steps
      - Overall sprint goal

      ## Step 2: Research Codebase
      Use the Explore subagent to investigate:
      - Project architecture and patterns
      - Test framework and conventions
      - Build/test/lint commands
      - Related existing code

      ## Step 3: Create Shared Context
      Create: context/_shared-context.md

      ```markdown
      # Sprint Context

      ## Project Info
      - Test framework: [vitest/jest/etc]
      - Test location: [pattern]
      - Build command: `[command]`
      - Test command: `[command]`
      - Lint command: `[command]`

      ## Patterns to Follow
      [Key patterns discovered in codebase]

      ## Sprint Steps Overview
      [Brief summary of each step and dependencies]
      ```

      ## Step 4: Commit
      ```bash
      git add context/
      git commit -m "preflight: sprint context prepared"
      ```

          GIVEN the need to optionally run sprints in dedicated worktrees
          WHEN users define a sprint or workflow
          THEN provide configuration options for automatic worktree creation

          ## Scope
          Define the schema for worktree configuration at workflow and sprint levels.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### SPRINT.yaml Schema Extension
          Add optional `worktree` configuration block:
          ```yaml
          # SPRINT.yaml
          workflow: my-workflow

          # Optional: Automatic worktree for this sprint
          worktree:
            enabled: true                              # Enable dedicated worktree
            branch: sprint/{sprint-id}                 # Branch name (supports variables)
            path: ../{sprint-id}-worktree              # Worktree path (relative to repo)
            cleanup: on-complete                       # never | on-complete | on-merge
          ```

          ### Workflow-level Defaults
          Workflows can set default worktree behavior:
          ```yaml
          # workflows/feature-development.yaml
          name: feature-development
          worktree:
            enabled: true                              # All sprints using this workflow
            branch-prefix: sprint/                     # Default branch prefix
            path-prefix: ../worktrees/                 # Default worktree location
            cleanup: on-complete
          ```

          ### Sprint Overrides Workflow
          - [ ] Sprint-level `worktree` config overrides workflow defaults
          - [ ] `enabled: false` in sprint disables even if workflow enables
          - [ ] Missing config = inherit from workflow or disabled

          ### Variable Substitution
          Support these variables in branch/path:
          - `{sprint-id}` → e.g., `2026-01-20_feature-auth`
          - `{sprint-name}` → e.g., `feature-auth`
          - `{date}` → e.g., `2026-01-20`
          - `{workflow}` → e.g., `feature-development`

          ### Type Definitions
          ```typescript
          interface WorktreeConfig {
            enabled: boolean;
            branch?: string;        // Default: sprint/{sprint-id}
            path?: string;          // Default: ../{sprint-id}-worktree
            cleanup?: 'never' | 'on-complete' | 'on-merge';
          }
          ```

          ### Validation Rules
          - [ ] Branch name must be valid git ref
          - [ ] Path must not conflict with existing directories
          - [ ] Cleanup mode validated against enum

          ## Files to Modify
          - plugins/m42-sprint/compiler/src/types.ts (add WorktreeConfig)
          - plugins/m42-sprint/compiler/src/schema.ts (validation)

                branch-prefix: sprint/                     # Default branch prefix
                path-prefix: ../worktrees/                 # Default worktree location

          GIVEN the worktree configuration schema from Step 0
          WHEN a user runs /start-sprint with worktree enabled
          THEN automatically create git branch and worktree

          ## Scope
          Modify /start-sprint to create worktree when configured.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Branch Creation
          - [ ] Create new branch from current HEAD (or specified base)
          - [ ] Branch name from config with variable substitution
          - [ ] Fail gracefully if branch already exists (offer to reuse)

          ### Worktree Creation
          - [ ] Run `git worktree add <path> <branch>`
          - [ ] Path from config with variable substitution
          - [ ] Create parent directories if needed
          - [ ] Validate path doesn't already exist

          ### Sprint Directory Setup
          - [ ] Create .claude/sprints/{sprint-id}/ in the NEW worktree
          - [ ] Copy SPRINT.yaml to worktree's sprint directory
          - [ ] Initialize PROGRESS.yaml with worktree metadata

          ### PROGRESS.yaml Worktree Fields
          ```yaml
          worktree:
            enabled: true
            branch: sprint/feature-auth
            path: /absolute/path/to/worktree
            working-dir: /absolute/path/to/worktree  # Where Claude executes
            created-at: 2026-01-20T10:00:00Z
            cleanup: on-complete
          ```

          ### User Feedback

          ```

          ### Error Handling
          - [ ] Branch exists → offer to checkout existing or create new name
          - [ ] Directory exists → fail with clear message

        prompt: |
          GIVEN that Claude currently executes with cwd=sprintDir (.claude/sprints/xxx/)
          WHEN users expect Claude to operate naturally in the codebase
          THEN change runtime to execute Claude from project/worktree root

          ## Scope
          **CRITICAL**: Modify the sprint runtime to execute Claude from the correct directory.

          ## The Problem
          Current behavior in loop.ts:
          ```typescript
          const spawnResult = await deps.runClaude({
            prompt,
            cwd: sprintDir,  // ← This is .claude/sprints/2026-01-20_feature/
            outputFile,
          });
          ```

          Claude thinks it's in the sprint metadata folder, not the project!

          ## The Solution
          ```typescript
          const spawnResult = await deps.runClaude({
            prompt,
            cwd: progress.worktree?.['working-dir'] ?? getProjectRoot(sprintDir),
            outputFile,
          });
          ```

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### working-dir Field in PROGRESS.yaml
          - [ ] Add `working-dir` field (absolute path where Claude executes)
          - [ ] For worktree sprints: worktree root
          - [ ] For non-worktree sprints: project root (git root or cwd)
          - [ ] Populated by compiler/start-sprint

          ### Project Root Detection
          - [ ] `getProjectRoot(sprintDir)` → finds git root or falls back
          - [ ] Respects worktree boundaries (doesn't escape to main repo)
          - [ ] Handles non-git directories gracefully

          ### Runtime Changes (loop.ts)
          - [ ] Read `working-dir` from PROGRESS.yaml
          - [ ] Pass as `cwd` to runClaude()
          - [ ] Sprint directory still used for PROGRESS.yaml writes
          - [ ] Transcriptions still written to sprint directory

          ### Path Handling
          - [ ] All file paths in prompts work relative to working-dir
          - [ ] Absolute paths still work
          - [ ] Sprint-relative paths (for artifacts) documented

          ### Backwards Compatibility
          - [ ] If `working-dir` missing, fall back to getProjectRoot()
          - [ ] Existing sprints continue to work

          ### Test Cases
          - [ ] Sprint without worktree: cwd = project root
          - [ ] Sprint with worktree: cwd = worktree root
          - [ ] File operations work naturally (Read, Write, Edit)
          - [ ] Git operations work in correct directory

          ## Files to Modify
          - plugins/m42-sprint/runtime/src/loop.ts (cwd change)
          - plugins/m42-sprint/runtime/src/worktree.ts (getProjectRoot)

              - [ ] Read `working-dir` from PROGRESS.yaml
              - [ ] Pass as `cwd` to runClaude()
              - [ ] Sprint directory still used for PROGRESS.yaml writes
              - [ ] Transcriptions still written to sprint directory

              ### Path Handling
              - [ ] All file paths in prompts work relative to working-dir
              - [ ] Absolute paths still work
              - [ ] Sprint-relative paths (for artifacts) documented

              ### Backwards Compatibility
              - [ ] If `working-dir` missing, fall back to getProjectRoot()
              - [ ] Existing sprints continue to work

              ### Test Cases
              - [ ] Sprint without worktree: cwd = project root
              - [ ] Sprint with worktree: cwd = worktree root
              - [ ] File operations work naturally (Read, Write, Edit)
              - [ ] Git operations work in correct directory

          GIVEN the runtime now executes in project/worktree root
          WHEN multiple developers want to run sprints in parallel across worktrees
          THEN add worktree awareness and isolation to prevent conflicts

          ## Scope
          Enhance sprint initialization and execution to detect and isolate by worktree.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Worktree Detection
          - [ ] Detect if running in a git worktree
          - [ ] Get worktree root path (not just repo root)
          - [ ] Generate unique worktree identifier (hash of worktree path)

          ### PROGRESS.yaml Enhancement
          - [ ] Add `worktree-id` field to PROGRESS.yaml
          - [ ] Add `worktree-path` field for debugging
          - [ ] Automatically populate on sprint start

          ### Isolation Validation
          - [ ] Verify .claude/sprints/ is local to each worktree
          - [ ] Verify PROGRESS.yaml writes are worktree-local
          - [ ] Test: same sprint name in two worktrees = two separate sprints

          ### Helper Functions
          - [ ] `getWorktreeInfo()` → { isWorktree, path, id, mainWorktreePath }
          - [ ] `validateWorktreeIsolation()` → boolean

          ### Tests
          - [ ] Unit test: worktree detection logic

          ## Scope
          Extend /sprint-status command to show sprints across all worktrees.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Command Enhancement
          - [ ] Add `--all-worktrees` flag to /sprint-status
          - [ ] Discover all worktrees in repository
          - [ ] Read PROGRESS.yaml from each worktree's .claude/sprints/

          ### Status Display
          - [ ] Show worktree path for each sprint
          - [ ] Show worktree-id for verification
          - [ ] Indicate current worktree with marker (*)
          - [ ] Color-code by status (in-progress=yellow, completed=green, etc.)

          ### Output Format

          THEN detect and prevent conflicts

          ## Scope
          Add conflict detection for operations that touch shared state.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Shared Resource Detection
          - [ ] Identify shared resources: git config, shared branches, global state
          - [ ] Lock mechanism for git operations (branch creation, commits)
          - [ ] Detect if another sprint is modifying same branch

          ### Git Operation Safety
          - [ ] Check if sprint branch already exists in another worktree
          - [ ] Warn before creating branch with same name
          - [ ] Suggest branch name with worktree suffix if conflict

          ### Lock Files
          - [ ] Create .sprint-locks/ directory in repo root (shared across worktrees)
          - [ ] Lock format: {operation}-{worktree-id}.lock
          - [ ] Auto-cleanup stale locks (older than 1 hour)

          ### Conflict Messages
          ```
          Warning: Sprint "feature-auth" is already running in another worktree:
            Worktree: /home/user/project-main
            Branch: sprint/feature-auth
            Status: in-progress

          Suggestions:
            1. Use a different sprint name: /start-sprint feature-auth-v2
            2. Stop the other sprint first: cd /path && /stop-sprint
            3. Continue anyway (not recommended): --force
          ```

          ### Tests

          ## Scope
          Implement cleanup strategies for sprint worktrees.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Cleanup Modes
          - `never`: Worktree persists indefinitely
          - `on-complete`: Remove worktree when sprint status = completed
          - `on-merge`: Remove after branch is merged to main

          ### Cleanup Command
          - [ ] Add /cleanup-sprint command
          - [ ] Options: --force (skip confirmation), --keep-branch

          ### Automatic Cleanup
          - [ ] On sprint completion, check cleanup config
          - [ ] If `on-complete`, prompt user or auto-cleanup
          - [ ] Log cleanup actions

          ### Cleanup Steps
          1. Verify sprint is in terminal state (completed/blocked)
          2. Check for uncommitted changes in worktree
          3. Remove worktree: `git worktree remove <path>`
          4. Optionally delete branch: `git branch -d <branch>`
          5. Archive sprint directory (optional)

          ### Safety Checks
          - [ ] Never delete worktree with uncommitted changes
          - [ ] Never delete worktree if sprint is in-progress
          - [ ] Require --force for worktrees with unpushed commits

          THEN create comprehensive integration tests

          ## Scope
          Test real-world parallel sprint scenarios.

          ## Acceptance Criteria

          ### Test Scenarios
          - [ ] Sprint with worktree: auto-creates branch and worktree
          - [ ] Sprint without worktree: uses project root as cwd
          - [ ] Two worktrees, different sprints, run concurrently
          - [ ] Sprint status shows all worktrees correctly
          - [ ] Worktree cleanup works after completion
          - [ ] Conflict detection prevents branch name collisions

          ### Runtime Execution Tests
          - [ ] Claude executes in worktree root (not sprint dir)
          - [ ] File operations work relative to worktree
          - [ ] Git operations affect worktree's branch
          - [ ] PROGRESS.yaml still written to sprint directory

          ### Test Setup
          - [ ] Create temporary git repo
          - [ ] Initialize sprint with worktree config
          - [ ] Verify worktree created correctly
          - [ ] Run sprint, verify cwd is worktree

      ## Your Role: Documentation OPERATOR

      Update documentation by spawning subagents for each category.

      ## Step 1: Analyze Changes
      ```bash
      git diff main..HEAD --name-only
      git diff main..HEAD --stat
      ```

      Create a list of what changed and needs documenting.

      ## Step 2: Spawn Subagents (in parallel if independent)

      ### User Guide Subagent
      ```
      Task: Update user guide documentation

      Changes made in this sprint:
      [List relevant changes]

      Instructions:
      1. Find existing user guide (docs/USER-GUIDE.md or docs/user-guide/)
      2. Add/update sections for new features
      3. Update examples if behavior changed
      4. Keep it task-oriented and example-rich
      5. Commit: git commit -m "docs(user-guide): update for sprint changes"

      Skip if: No user-facing feature changes
      ```

      ### Getting Started Subagent
      ```
      Task: Update getting started / quickstart docs

      Changes made in this sprint:
      [List relevant changes]

      Instructions:
      1. Find quickstart docs (README.md, docs/getting-started/)
      2. Update installation steps if changed
      3. Update first-steps examples if affected
      4. Ensure copy-paste commands work
      5. Commit: git commit -m "docs(getting-started): update for sprint changes"

      Skip if: No changes affect onboarding flow
      ```

      ### Reference Docs Subagent
      ```
      Task: Update reference documentation

      Changes made in this sprint:
      [List relevant changes]

      3. Update configuration options
      4. Update type definitions
      5. Commit: git commit -m "docs(reference): update for sprint changes"

      Skip if: No API/config/type changes
      ```

      ## Step 3: Verify All Documentation
      - Run code examples from docs to verify they work
      - Check internal links are valid
      - Ensure consistency across all doc updates

      ## Output
      Create: artifacts/docs-summary.md

      ## Your Role: QA OPERATOR

      Verify the entire sprint meets quality standards.

      ## Step 1: Build Verification
      ```bash
      npm run build
      npm run typecheck
      npm run lint
      ```

      All must pass. If any fail, spawn fix subagent.

      ## Step 2: Full Test Suite
      ```bash
      npm test
      ```

      All tests must pass. Record coverage if available.

      ## Step 3: Review All Step Artifacts
      Read each artifacts/{{step.id}}-complete.md to verify all steps finished.

      ## Step 4: Integration Check
      - Verify modules import correctly
      - Check for circular dependencies
      - Run any integration tests

      ## Step 5: Generate QA Report
      Create: artifacts/sprint-qa-report.md

      ```markdown
      # Sprint QA Report

      ## Build Status
      | Check | Status |
      |-------|--------|
      | Build | PASS/FAIL |
      | TypeCheck | PASS/FAIL |
      | Lint | PASS/FAIL |

      ## Test Results
      - Total: [N]
      - Passed: [N]
      - Failed: [N]
      - Coverage: [%]

      ## Step Verification
      | Step | Status |
      |------|--------|
      | [step-id] | COMPLETE |

      ## Overall: PASS / FAIL
      ```

      ## Handle Failures
      If any check fails:
      1. Spawn fix subagent with specific error details
      2. Re-run verification
      3. If still failing, escalate to human

      Commit:
      ```bash
      git add artifacts/sprint-qa-report.md
