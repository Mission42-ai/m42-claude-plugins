I've completed the implementation phase for step-9 (Phase 3.1). Here's what was done:

**Created:** `plugins/m42-sprint/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md`

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites check section with commands for verifying yq and Node.js
- Installation instructions for macOS and Linux
- Step 1: Create a sprint (`/start-sprint`)
- Step 2: Add first step (`/add-step`)
- Step 3: Add second step (demonstrates multi-step sprints)
- Step 4: Run the sprint (`/run-sprint`)
- Step 5: Watch progress (`/sprint-status`)
- "What Just Happened?" explanation of the Fresh Context Pattern
- Next steps linking to related documentation
- Quick reference card

**Updated:**
- PROGRESS.yaml: marked implement sub-phase as completed, advanced pointer to QA sub-phase

**Committed:** `1e86db1` - docs: create docs/getting-started/quick-start.md 5-minute tutorial
