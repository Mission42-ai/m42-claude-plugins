I have completed the **implement** sub-phase for Phase 1.5. Here's what was accomplished:

**Created:** `plugins/m42-sprint/docs/concepts/workflow-compilation.md`

**Content includes:**
- Compilation pipeline visualization (ASCII diagram showing Load → Resolve → Expand → Substitute → Generate)
- Step-by-step explanation of each stage with code references to the actual compiler modules
- Complete example showing transformation from SPRINT.yaml through workflow resolution to PROGRESS.yaml
- Template variables reference table (`{{step.prompt}}`, `{{step.id}}`, `{{phase.id}}`, `{{sprint.id}}`, etc.)
- Variable availability matrix (which variables work in which contexts)
- Compiler module overview showing file structure and responsibilities
- Validation stages and error codes documentation
- Links to related documentation

**PROGRESS.yaml updated:**
- Marked `phases[1].steps[4].phases[0]` (implement) as completed
- Advanced pointer to `sub-phase: 1` (QA phase)

**Committed:** `21e4b14` - "docs: create docs/concepts/workflow-compilation.md compilation guide"
