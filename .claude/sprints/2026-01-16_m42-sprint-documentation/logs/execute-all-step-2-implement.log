Done. I have completed the implementation of Phase 1.3: `docs/concepts/overview.md`.

**Summary of what was created:**

The `plugins/m42-sprint/docs/concepts/overview.md` file includes:

1. **Three-Tier Model Diagram** - ASCII art showing the flow from SPRINT.yaml through the TypeScript Compiler to PROGRESS.yaml and the Ralph Loop
2. **Ralph Loop Visualization** - ASCII diagram showing the fresh context execution pattern with the loop cycle
3. **Component Map** - Directory structure of the plugin showing commands, compiler, scripts, docs, and skills
4. **"Why This Architecture?" Section** - Explains separation of concerns and the benefits of fresh context execution
5. **Key Benefits Table** - Summarizes advantages like reliable long sprints, simple step definition, reusable workflows, automatic tracking
6. **Links to Deep Dive Docs** - References to ralph-loop.md, workflow-compilation.md, quick-start.md, and commands.md

The PROGRESS.yaml has been updated to mark the implement sub-phase as completed and advance the pointer to sub-phase 1 (qa).
