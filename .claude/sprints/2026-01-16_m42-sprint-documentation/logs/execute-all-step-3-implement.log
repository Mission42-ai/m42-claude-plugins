Phase 1.4 implementation complete. I created `docs/concepts/ralph-loop.md` which:

- Explains the context accumulation problem with ASCII visualization
- Presents the fresh context solution with detailed diagrams
- Includes a full sequence diagram showing one loop iteration
- Provides a key benefits table with cost comparison
- Documents implementation details with code examples from `sprint-loop.sh`
- Compares the Ralph Loop to alternatives (long sessions, agent frameworks)
- Makes the "Ralph Loop" name memorable and explains its origin

The sub-phase is marked completed and the pointer advanced to QA (sub-phase 1). Exiting as instructed.
