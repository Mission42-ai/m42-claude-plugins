Task completed. I created `plugins/m42-sprint/docs/guides/writing-workflows.md` with comprehensive workflow authoring documentation including:

- **Workflow Basics**: File location, minimal structure, required/optional fields
- **Phase Types**: Simple phases (with prompts) and for-each phases (with workflow references)
- **Template Variables**: Complete reference with `{{step.*}}`, `{{phase.*}}`, `{{sprint.*}}` variables and availability matrix
- **Seven Workflow Patterns**:
  1. Minimal Execute - single-phase for simple tasks
  2. Plan-Execute - two-phase with planning
  3. Plan-Execute-Verify - three-phase with verification
  4. Full Feature Lifecycle - four-phase complete implementation
  5. Sprint with For-Each - top-level sprint orchestration
  6. Bug Fix Workflow - diagnosis-focused
  7. Flat For-Each - minimal iteration
- **Pattern Selection Guide**: Decision tree for choosing the right pattern
- **Nested Workflows**: How for-each phases reference other workflows
- **Testing and Validation**: YAML syntax checks, compilation testing, validation rules
- **Migration Guide**: From shell scripts, inline steps, and manual execution
- **Best Practices**: Prompt writing, phase design, workflow organization
- **Advanced Patterns**: Conditional artifacts, shared context, QA gates
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

The PROGRESS.yaml has been updated and changes committed.
