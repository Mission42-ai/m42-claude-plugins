        Create a skill for the m42-sprint plugin that contains domain knowledge about creating sprints from plan files.

        ## Goal
        Provide reference knowledge for transforming plan documents into SPRINT.yaml files.

        ## Content to Include
        - SPRINT.yaml schema and structure
        - How to extract steps from plan documents
        - Workflow selection guidance based on task types
        - Collection item patterns and examples
        - Best practices for step prompts

    - id: sprint-creator-subagent
      prompt: |
        /m42-meta-toolkit:create-subagent

        Create a subagent for the m42-sprint plugin that specializes in creating sprints from plan files and/or additional documents.

        ## Goal
        Users should be able to provide plan files (markdown documents describing goals, tasks, requirements)
        and have this subagent generate a properly structured SPRINT.yaml file.

        ## Core Capabilities
        - Parse plan files to understand goals and tasks
        - Generate SPRINT.yaml with appropriate structure
        - Support additional context documents (requirements, specs, etc.)
        - Reference the creating-sprints skill for domain knowledge

        ## Integration Points
        - Should work with /init-sprint command flow
        - Should integrate with the m42-sprint plugin structure

        ## User Experience
        - Accept plan file paths as input
        - Ask clarifying questions when plan is ambiguous
        - Generate step collection items from plan tasks
        - Suggest appropriate workflow based on plan content
