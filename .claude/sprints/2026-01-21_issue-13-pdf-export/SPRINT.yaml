      Step 1: Research and setup PDF generation infrastructure.

      Tasks:
      - Analyze existing sprint summary structure and data available
      - Research PDF generation options (puppeteer, pdfkit, jspdf, etc.)
      - Choose library that supports both text and chart/image embedding
      - Add required dependencies to the plugin
      - Create basic PDF generation utility module

      Output: Working PDF generation setup with dependency installed.

  - prompt: |
      Step 2: Implement core PDF export with sprint data.

      Tasks:
      - Create PDF template/layout for sprint summary
      - Include sprint metadata (name, dates, status)
      - Add step listing with status indicators
      - Include timing information and completion percentages
      - Format text content for readability (headers, sections, spacing)

      Output: Basic PDF export that renders sprint text content.

  - prompt: |
      Step 3: Add visual progress chart to PDF.

      Tasks:
      - Generate visual chart showing sprint progress (e.g., pie chart, progress bar, or timeline)
      - Chart should display: completed vs pending vs failed steps
      - Consider adding timeline visualization if timestamps available
      - Ensure chart renders cleanly in PDF format
      - Use charting library compatible with PDF generation (e.g., chart.js with canvas, SVG-based)

      Output: PDF now includes visual progress chart.

  - prompt: |
      Step 4: Create command/skill for PDF export.

      Tasks:
      - Add new command or extend existing command with --pdf flag
      - Command should accept sprint path as argument
      - Output PDF to sprint's artifacts/ directory
      - Add proper error handling and user feedback
      - Ensure command works from CLI

      Output: Working /export-pdf command or --pdf flag on existing command.

  - prompt: |
      Step 5: Documentation and final polish.

      Tasks:
      - Add documentation for PDF export feature
      - Update README or relevant docs
      - Add usage examples
      - Test end-to-end workflow
      - Close GitHub Issue #13 with summary of implementation

      Output: Feature complete with documentation, issue closed.
